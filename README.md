## üöÄ Project Overview

The **Movie Genre Classifier** is a machine learning-based application that predicts the genre of a movie given a set of features such as movie title, description, and other metadata. The dataset used includes several movie features, and the model is trained using classification algorithms.

### Features:
- Preprocessing of movie data
- Feature extraction and vectorization
- Classification using machine learning models
- Evaluation and accuracy reporting
- GUI using `Tkinter` (if applicable)

## üß† Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK
- Tkinter (GUI)
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/allakaushik/Movie-Genre-Codsoft-.git
   cd Movie-Genre-Codsoft-
   ```

2. **Create Virtual Environment (Optional)**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## üß™ Usage

1. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. Open the `.ipynb` file and run each cell step by step to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate accuracy.

3. (Optional) If a GUI is provided, run the script:
   ```bash
   python movie_genre_gui.py
   ```

## üìà Model Accuracy

The model was evaluated using accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report. Example accuracy achieved:

- Logistic Regression: **xx%**
- Random Forest: **xx%**
- Naive Bayes: **xx%**

> Update this section based on your actual model evaluation.
